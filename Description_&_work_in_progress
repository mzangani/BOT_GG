Initial work on the modeling.


the whole document will be updated with the extensive EDA section (the section will be updated as junction project)
All the features will be analysed and engineered to improve modeling.
Pipelline and crossvalidations will be implemented

Clustering will be tested to further improve the model

More real examples will be tested with new available data
